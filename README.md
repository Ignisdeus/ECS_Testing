# ECS_Testing
This document will outline the plan for this project, with scene progressions and behaviours found within each scene. 
Scene 1: 
![Scene_One](ECS_Testing/Images/Scene_One.jpeg)
 
-	Big carrier ship (Wonder) fly’s through space with a wonder behaviour. 
-	Camera (Path Follow) circles the carer ship.
-	Carrier ship (Seek) jumps to FTL.
Scene 2-3:

<img src="Images\Scene_Three.jpeg" alt="Scene_One" height="672" width="518">
-	Camera (Seek Behaviour) follow the ship as the fly’s in hyperspace effect. 
-	Camera (remove All active Behaviours after a few seconds camera becomes inactive) slows down as ship disappears in a flash of light. 
 
Scene 4: 
 <img src="Images\Scene_Four.jpeg" alt="Scene_One" height="672" width="518">
-	Mother ship (Seek Behaviour) attacks the carrier ship knocking it out of hyperspace.
-	Camera shake at point of impact. 
-	Both ships are knocked out the hyperspace. 
Scene 5: 
<img src="Images\Scene_Five.jpeg" alt="Scene_One" height="672" width="518">
-	Both ships start to cycle each other (Path following).
-	Lots of little ships begin to fight emerging form mother larger ships (Seek, obstacle avoidance, pursue, off set pursue).
Scene 6: 
 <img src="Images\Scene_Six.jpeg" alt="Scene_One" height="672" width="518">
-	Large ships launch bombers to destroy the other (Pursue).
Scene 7: 

-	Depending on the outcome of the attack runs one of the ships is destroyed and the other ship jumps to FTL to end the simulation.
