# ECS_Testing
This document will outline the plan for this project, with scene progressions and behaviours found within each scene. 

**Scene 1:** 

![Scene_One](https://github.com/Ignisdeus/ECS_Testing/blob/master/Images/Scene_One.jpg)
 
-	Big carrier ship (Wonder) fly’s through space with a wonder behaviour. 
-	Camera (Path Follow) circles the carer ship.
-	Carrier ship (Seek) jumps to FTL.

**Scene 2-3:**

  ![Scene_Three](https://github.com/Ignisdeus/ECS_Testing/blob/master/Images/Scene_Three.jpg)
-	Camera (Seek Behaviour) follow the ship as the fly’s in hyperspace effect. 
-	Camera (remove All active Behaviours after a few seconds camera becomes inactive) slows down as ship disappears in a flash of light. 
 
**Scene 4:**

-	Mother ship (Seek Behaviour) attacks the carrier ship knocking it out of hyperspace.
-	Camera shake at point of impact. 
-	Both ships are knocked out the hyperspace. 

**Scene 5:** 

 ![Scene_Five](https://github.com/Ignisdeus/ECS_Testing/blob/master/Images/Scene_Five.jpg)
-	Both ships start to cycle each other (Path following).
-	Lots of little ships begin to fight emerging form mother larger ships (Seek, obstacle avoidance, pursue, off set pursue).

**Scene 6:** 

 ![Scene_Six](https://github.com/Ignisdeus/ECS_Testing/blob/master/Images/Scene_Six.jpg)
-	Large ships launch bombers to destroy the other (Pursue).

**Scene 7:** 

-	Depending on the outcome of the attack runs one of the ships is destroyed and the other ship jumps to FTL to end the simulation.
